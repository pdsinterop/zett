# zett, a [solid](https://solidproject.org/) editor

Zett aims to make it easy to create and edit linked data, and visualize it. 

Zett is a structured editor, which makes sure you end up with syntactically valid linked data. It is also a demo of the PDS Interop Solid Migrator metadata specification. You can open multiple resources and move data entities from one resource to another, while leaving a 'breadcrumb trail' behind. This means that if other linked data links to an entity in your resource, and you move the linked entity to a new resource, zett leaves a redirect instruction in the original location.

Zett is initially developed for the [DAPSI](https://dapsi.ngi.eu/) [PDS Migrator](https://pdsinterop.org/solid-migrator/) project.
